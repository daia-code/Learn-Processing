# Chart pie
In statistical applications it is necessary to represent pie charts (pie
chart) for a set of values represented as a percentage.
The elements are stored in a vector, and their sum is 100%.
Example:
float [] values = {25.0, 45.0, 5.0, 15.0, 10.0};
Implement a function that draws a pie chart by receiving this vector
as a parameter. The function will also receive the center and radius of the diagram.
The number of elements in the vector can be found using the length attribute.
Randomly choose a color for each sector.
